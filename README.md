# AIML Chatbot kernel #

This is a Jupyter kernel that deploys a chatbot, implemented using the 
[pyAIML][] library. The idea was taken from the [Calysto chatbot][] kernel.

It has been tested with Python 2.7 and Jupyter 4.1


## AIML ##

[AIML][] is an XML-based specification to design conversational agents. Its 
most famous application is ALICE, a chat robot (the free version of ALICE is 
included in this kernel)
