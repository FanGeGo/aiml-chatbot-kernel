AIML Chatbot kernel
===================

This is a Jupyter kernel that deploys a chatbot, implemented using the 
`pyAIML`_ library. The idea was taken from the `Calysto chatbot`_ kernel.

It has been tested with Python 2.7 and Jupyter 4.1

A number of magics are provided to help with loading AIML databases and 
inspecting/modifying the bot state. Use the `%help` magic for initial 
instructions.

`AIML`_ is an XML-based specification to design conversational agents. Its 
most famous application is ALICE, a chatbot (the DB for the free version of 
ALICE is included in this kernel)
